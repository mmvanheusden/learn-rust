**Learning Rust.**  
Every piece of leaning code is in the `Experiments` folder. And are called Experiments.  
I use the [Rust programming Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) as a reference. Note 'reference', I merely use this book as a reference, I don't strictly follow it. You'll see me adding other stuff from time to time as well.

To run the code, first install Rust.  
Then run the code: `./run.sh <experiment_name>`.
For example: `./run.sh HelloWorld` will run the HelloWorld experiment.

```text
$ ./run.sh HelloWorld
 Clearing old build...
 Compiling HelloWorld.rs...
 Running HelloWorld...

 Hello, world!
```
