**Learning Rust.**  
Every piece of leaning code is in the `Experiments` folder. And are called Experiments.

To run the code, first install Rust.  
Then run the code: `./run.sh <experiment_name>`.
For example: `./run.sh HelloWorld` will run the HelloWorld experiment.

```text
$ ./run.sh HelloWorld
 Clearing old build...
 Compiling HelloWorld.rs...
 Running HelloWorld...

 Hello, world!
```
