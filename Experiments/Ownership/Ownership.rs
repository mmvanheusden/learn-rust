     * The difference between the STACK and the HEAP

     STACK:
        The stack stores and handles memory a bit like a stack of plates:
        The last plate that has been added to the pile will also be the first to leave it.
        Adding data to the stack is called pushing and removing data is called popping.
        All data on the stack needs to have a fixed size.
     HEAP:
        The heap is less organised.
